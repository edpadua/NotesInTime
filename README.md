## About

This project consists of an annotation registration system. The user types the text in the input field and can also insert an image in the note by a button next to this field and then saves the note and it is shown in a list. Each note has the text, the image, if this has been inserted, in addition to recording the date and time of the moment it is saved. The purpose of this project is to put some front end and React library concepts into practice, in addition to developing a system that can be useful for several everyday situations, where we need to take notes and record information quickly, with date stamp and time. The system can evolve and the data persistence part will be developed later.
